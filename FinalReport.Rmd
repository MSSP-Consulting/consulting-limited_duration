## Introduction
This project is a continuation of a consulting project done by MSSP in Summer 2020.  

Our client, Dr. Catherine Ritz is from the Wheelock College of Education at Boston University. Her study is for assessing learning practices and outcomes and seeks to understand the learner proficiency outcomes, programming/instructional practices, and the effect of different programming/practices on outcomes through a large-scale quantitative survey of public school (K-12) districts in Massachusetts.  This survey collected responses grouped into three categories.  

**Demographics:** this includes basic information about the school and educator.  

**Program Type:** this is divided into Elementary, Middle, and High subsets and includes program information and outcomes.  

**Foreign Language Instruction:** Likert scale statements about instructional practices.  

Although the client’s research is more extensive, her questions for us in this time-limited consulting are:

**A.** Visualize the respondents by *Title* (Administrator or Teacher), *Language(s) Taught*, and *Levels Taught* (Elementary school, Middle School, or High school)

**B.** Visualize the responses to the question ‘Has your school or district established proficiency targets for each of the levels of world language study?’ by level (elementary school, middle school, and high school)

**C.** Check the internal consistency of scores in the Teacher Practices section by Cronbach's alpha coefficients.

\newpage  
## A.1 *Title*
Some respondents signified that they are the world language chair in the `demographics: your title` column, some did not show this information in this column but answered "I am the World Language Program chair/administrator/supervisor" in questions `languages taught` and `what level do you currently teach`. We cleaned the data to collect up these respondents and filtered twice to make sure we get the correct title information.

For the first filter, we selected people who have one of the words 'head', 'chair', 'leader', 'chairperson', 'director', 'supervisor', and 'administrator' in their title and who say their title is Administrator.

For the second filter, we change the title from 'Teacher' to 'Administrator' of people who only indicated they are 'Teacher' in the 'demographics your title' question but answered "I am the World Language Program chair/administrator/supervisor" in later question.

Our result shows that among the 600 respondents, 20% of them are Administrator, and 80% of them are Teacher.

## A.2 *Language(s) Taught*

For the language part, we faound that there are 12 unique levels of language. 

Note that for those who teach several languages, they are counted as 1 in every language they teach. This is what we mean by 'aggregated' in the plot title.

Here are the languages and the corresponding counts:

Chinese 39, French 167, Latin 51, Spanish 380, Portuguese 17, Italian 35, Other (please specify) 7, German 11, American Sign Language (ASL) 5,
Hebrew 1, Arabic 1, Japanese 1  
  
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# create data frame with each kind of language and the corresponding count
# a person will be counted as 1 in all language levels that this person taught

language.df <- data.frame(language = character(), count = numeric())
data2$languages_taught[data2$languages_taught ==""] <- NA
data2 <- na.omit(data2)

for(i in 1:nrow(data2)){
  split <- unlist(strsplit(data2$languages_taught[i], ","))
  ind <- length(split) 
   for (j in 1:ind){
     lan <- split[j]
     if(!split[j] %in% language.df$language){
       # print(i)
       # print(split[j])
       language.df <- rbind.data.frame(language.df, cbind.data.frame(language = lan, count = 1))
     } else{
       ind2 <- which(language.df$language == lan)
       language.df[ind2,]$count <- language.df[ind2,]$count + 1
     }
   }
}
    
# visualize language_taught distribution
ggplot(language.df, aes(x = language, y = count, fill = language)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.8, position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = -0.2, color= "black", size=3) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust=1),legend.position="none") +
  labs(title = "Languages taught by each individual - aggregated")
```

\newpage  
## A.3 *Levels Taught*
Just as we did for language, each person is counted as 1 in all levels that this person teaches. 

There were 52 people who taught at the elementary level, 408 people teach at the high school level, and 174 people teach at the middle school level. There are also 7 people who teach Higher education level and 3 people in Adult Continuing Education level, but we have excluded those respondents in this visualization. 
  
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}
# create data frame with teach levels (ele,mid,high) and the corresponding counts
# a person will be counted as 1 in all levels that this person taught

level.df <- data.frame(level = character(), count = numeric())
data3$what_level_s_do_you_currently_teach_please_check_all_that_apply[data3$what_level_s_do_you_currently_teach_please_check_all_that_apply == ""] <- NA
data3 <- na.omit(data3)


for(i in 1:nrow(data3)){
  split <- unlist(strsplit(data3$what_level_s_do_you_currently_teach_please_check_all_that_apply[i], ","))
  ind <- length(split) 
   for (j in 1:ind){
     lev <- split[j]
     if(!lev %in% level.df$level){
       # print(i)
       # print(split[j])
       level.df <- rbind.data.frame(level.df, cbind.data.frame(level = lev, count = 1))
     } else{
       ind2 <- which(level.df$level == lev)
       level.df[ind2,]$count <- level.df[ind2,]$count + 1
     }
   }
}

# only keep level = ele, mid, and high
ele_mid_high <- level.df[c(1,2,4),]

# visualize teach level distrubution
ggplot(ele_mid_high, aes(x = level, y = count, fill = level)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.8, position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = 2, color= "black", size=3) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 20), legend.position="none") +
  labs(title = "Level taught by each individual - aggregated")
```

\newpage  
## B. Response to the question: *Has your school or district established proficiency targets for each of the levels of world language study?*

The following plots present the answers in elementary level, middle level, and high level. 

We excluded the answer "Not sure".

And we have modified the selection of districts.  Last summer Ryan filtered by including all administrators who responded, and then for districts that did not have an administrator response, he selected the first teacher respondent from that districts.  In doing this, there were 180 districts represented.  But there were several districts where there was more than one administrator response.  So we have filtered to find the districts presented in the following visualization by following the following selection rules:  

For each district:  
* If one or more administrators, include the administrator with greater progress (shown in the `response_num` column)  
* If more than one administrator has the same level of progress, take the first administrator  
* If no admin, take the first teacher to respond to the survey  

This gave us responses from 172 unique school districts.  
  
  
```{r, echo = FALSE}

## C. Internal consistency of question groups

For each of the question groupings that you have given us, we have:  
  
1) Reversed the scores for the questions that you identified.  
  
2) Within each question-group we have created a correlation matrix of those questions.  Because you reversed the scores for questions, all of the correlations are positive.  Within the correlation matrix you can see the pairs of questions that have the highest correlation.  (Reminder: A correlation score of 1.0 is a perfect correlation between two questions.  A correlation score of 0.0 says that there is no correlation between two questions.  In group1, you can see that the highest correlation between questions is between Q6: Tchr_uses_trgt_lang_90prct and Q12: Tchr_DOESNOT_use_Eng_as_prmy_lng).  
  
3) Within each question-group we have calculated the Cronbach's alpha.  Cronbach's alpha (or the "coefficient alpha") measures the internal consistency within a group of questions.  It, like correlation, also ranges between 0 and 1.  And in the social sciences, the following table gives the most widely used interpretation of a Cronbach's alpha score.  If you wish to learn more about Cronbach's alpha, the following is a useful link: [https://data.library.virginia.edu/using-and-interpreting-cronbachs-alpha/](https://data.library.virginia.edu/using-and-interpreting-cronbachs-alpha/)  
  
![Common Cronbach's alpha interpretation]("C_alpha_interpretation.png")  
  
4) There are other measures of internal consistency for survey questions, and recent work is pointing to the use of a measure called McDonald's omega.  If you wish to learn more about McDonald's omega, the following is a useful link: [https://personality-project.org/r/psych/HowTo/omega.pdf](https://personality-project.org/r/psych/HowTo/omega.pdf)
